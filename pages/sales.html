 <p>AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to their clients
    with it head office in New Dehli India and has regional offices around the country. Bhavya Patel,
     the sales director of the company is having a challenge tracking sales in a dynamically growing 
     market. The regional managers contact Bhavya Patel over a phone call to give him insights of sales
     and the problem with this is that it is verbal communication and the managers have this habit of 
     trying to sugar coat the facts or painting a rosy picture because they don’t want to look bad. </p>

<p> Bhavya Patel is getting frustrated because he can notice sales are declining but when talking to his 
    managers, he not getting the complete picture. When he asks for numbers, they give him a lot of Excel 
    files whereas he just needs to understand in simplistic terms how is the business performing, what are
     the weakest areas they need to focus on and if there is a decline in sales in a certain region maybe they 
     can look to start some promotion offers or engage with customers in a better way. He is interested in getting
      a simple and digestible insights   </p>

<p style ="font-weight: bold;"> Summary </p>

  <p>  The dashboard was developed in Power BI and before it was built the first step into solving
    this problem was accessing the database where all the sales data was stored and then running
     some queries to get some quick overview and understanding the data. The second step involved
      the ETL process which is Extract Transform and Load where the data was extracted from MySQL
       database to Power Query in Power BI where it was cleaned. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>
